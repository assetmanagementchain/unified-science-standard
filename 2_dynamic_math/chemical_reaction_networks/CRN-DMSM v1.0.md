# **Chemical Reaction Network — Dynamic Math Standard Model (CRN‑DMSM) v1.0**

### *A Dynamic‑Mathematics Standard for Chemical Reaction Networks, Reaction Geometry, and Stability Landscapes*

---

# **0. Overview**

CRN‑DMSM formalizes chemical reaction networks (CRNs) within the Dynamic Mathematics Mother Theory (DMMT). It treats CRNs as **rule‑driven dynamic systems** whose states (concentrations, spatial fields) and structures (reaction graph, catalysis topology) co‑evolve under fixed reaction rules. Stability, attractors, and reaction pathways are expressed as geometric objects in the state–structure space.

CRN‑DMSM provides:

* a compact axiomatic foundation for CRNs as DMMT objects
* canonical definitions for reaction structure, kinetics, energy/stability functions, and basins
* an implementation guide for simulation, basin extraction, and verification (Lean/mathOS)
* a compliance checklist for CRN‑DMSM certification

This standard covers mass‑action networks, generalized kinetics, catalytic networks, and spatially distributed reaction–diffusion systems.

# **1. Mapping CRN to DMMT**

Every CRN is embedded into the DMMT five‑tuple:

```
U_crn = (X, Σ, R, T, S)
```

Where:

* **X** = concentration/state space (vector of species concentrations, spatial fields, temperature variables)
* **Σ** = reaction structure (graph: species nodes, reaction edges, catalysts, compartments)
* **R** = reaction rules (stoichiometry, rate laws, catalytic modifiers)
* **T** = admissible transitions (reaction events, diffusion, transport)
* **S** = stability/energy function (chemical potential, Lyapunov candidate, free energy)

Evolution (continuous or discrete) is written as:

```
(x, σ) → (x + Δx, σ')  where Δx = F_R(x,σ) dt
```

with σ' capturing structural changes (e.g., assembly, complex formation, compartment fusion).

---

# **2. CRN‑DMSM Axioms**

These axioms specialize DMMT for chemical systems.

## **Axiom 1 — Reaction Generativity (R)**

Each CRN is defined by a finite (or countably generated) set of reaction constructors:

```
R = { r_i : α_i → β_i | rate law k_i(x,σ) }
```

Reactions can be elementary or composite; catalytic modifiers and compartments are expressed as annotations in Σ.

## **Axiom 2 — Mass/Conserved Quantities**

There exist conserved linear forms **C** (stoichiometric invariants):

```
C · x(t) = const  for closed systems
```

Open systems permit flux boundary terms.

## **Axiom 3 — Kinetic Admissibility (T)**

Transition vector field F_R(x,σ) is admissible if it is generated by R and obeys positivity and regularity:

```
F_R : X × Σ → TX   (continuous / locally Lipschitz)
```

Species concentrations remain non‑negative.

## **Axiom 4 — Stability / Energy Function (S)**

There exists a candidate S(x,σ) (e.g., Gibbs free energy, Lyapunov function) such that reaction flows do not increase S for isolated systems (or follow thermodynamic gradients):

```
dS/dt ≤ 0  (closed, dissipative systems)
```

Basins are defined by level sets of S.

## **Axiom 5 — Structural Events**

Structural transitions (assembly, complexation, bond formation, compartment changes) are admissible only if derivable from R and preserve chemical feasibility.

---

# **3. Key Definitions**

* **Species set**: V = {A, B, C,...}
* **Reaction**: r: ∑*j ν^-*{rj} X_j → ∑*j ν^+*{rj} X_j with rate k_r(x,σ)
* **Stoichiometric subspace**: S_row = span{ν_r}
* **Flux vector**: v(x,σ) = [v_r]_r with v_r = k_r(x,σ)·φ_r(x,σ)
* **Dynamics**: ẋ = N v(x,σ) + D(x,σ) (diffusion/transport)
* **Energy / Stability S(x,σ)**: scalar mapping giving basin geometry

# **4. Stability & Basin Theory for CRNs**

CRN‑DMSM uses S as the organizing geometry. Important results and constructs:

## **4.1 Detailed Balance & Lyapunov Functions**

For networks with detailed balance, classical free energy acts as S; convergence to equilibrium is guaranteed. DMMT extends this to generalized Lyapunov candidates for open/non‑detailed networks.

## **4.2 Multi‑stability & Bifurcations**

Multi‑stable chemical behavior arises from multiple basins in S. Bifurcations occur when parameters or structural events move basins or change their connectivity.

## **4.3 Reaction Pathways as Geodesics**

Minimal‑work transition paths between basins correspond to geodesic curves in S under an appropriate metric (Wasserstein-like or energy metric). These define most probable reaction pathways and activation barriers.

## **4.4 Catalysis, Enzymatic Networks, & Emergent Cores**

Catalysts modify effective rate laws and can create deep basins (functional cores). Assembly/disassembly events change Σ and can lead to emergent long‑lived structures.

---

# **5. Structural Changes & Higher‑Order Reactions**

CRN‑DMSM models structural changes (complex formation, macromolecular assembly) as discrete updates in Σ accompanied by state re‑projection. Higher‑order reactions (e.g., templated polymerization) can be represented via composite rule constructors.

---

# **6. Spatial Extension (Reaction‑Diffusion Systems)**

Spatial distributions x(r,t) and spatial structure Σ(r) are included: dynamics become PDEs:

```
∂x/∂t = N v(x,σ) + D ∇² x + boundary_terms
```

Stability geometry includes pattern basins (Turing patterns, waves) as spatial attractors.

# **7. CRN Implementation Guide (summary)**

1. **Reaction DSL / Rule Engine** — express R and Σ, support structural events
2. **Kinetic Simulator** — integrate ẋ = N v(x,σ) with positivity and stiff solvers
3. **Basin Analyzer** — compute S(x,σ), find basins, compute barrier heights
4. **Path Finder** — compute minimal‑work paths (geodesics) between basins
5. **Spatial Solver** — reaction‑diffusion numerics (finite elements / spectral)
6. **Formalization (Lean)** — stoichiometry, conservation laws, Lyapunov proofs
7. **mathOS** — auto‑discover Lyapunov candidates, basin geometry, and emergent cores

Recommended languages: Julia (numerics), Python (prototyping), Lean (formality), C++ (high performance).

# **8. CRN‑DMSM Compliance Checklist**

* [ ] Stoichiometric matrix N provided and invariants identified
* [ ] Kinetic laws specified with domain and regularity
* [ ] Stability function S proposed/estimated and basins identified
* [ ] Structural events and their admissibility documented
* [ ] Simulation traces available for representative trajectories
* [ ] Basin depth & barrier estimates reported
* [ ] Formal proofs for conserved quantities and candidate Lyapunov properties (where applicable)

# **9. Examples & Canonical Cases**

1. **Mass‑action reversible reaction** A ⇌ B — detailed balance, classical free energy S
2. **Autocatalytic set** — emergence of multiple basins and cores
3. **Enzymatic Michaelis–Menten module** — effective rate law and basin shaping
4. **Turing reaction‑diffusion pair** — spatial pattern basin emergence
5. **Polymerization with templating** — structural events (chain growth) changing Σ

Each example to be accompanied by: reaction DSL file, simulation trace, basin map, and Lean sketch proof (conserved quantities).

---

# **10. CRN‑DMSM & EMMT**

CRNs can cross into EMMT when reaction rules R themselves change over time (e.g., evolution of catalytic features, autocatalytic network growth). EMMT handles such meta‑dynamics where new reaction constructors are created or destroyed.

---

# **11. Summary**

CRN‑DMSM places chemical reaction networks squarely within the Dynamic Mathematics framework. It elevates reaction dynamics from heuristic kinetic modeling to a geometric, rule‑consistent, and formally verifiable science. CRN‑DMSM supports both classical chemical thermodynamics and modern systems chemistry, including emergent behavior, spatial patterning, and pathway geometry.
