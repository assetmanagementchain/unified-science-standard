# **System Science & Control Theory — Dynamic Math Standard Model (SSCT‑DMSM) v1.0**

### *A Unified Dynamic‑Mathematics Framework for Systems, Control, Stability, Feedback, and Trajectory Optimization*

---

# **0. Overview**

This document defines the **System Science & Control Theory Standard Model** under the **Dynamic Mathematics Mother Theory (DMMT)**.
SSCT‑DMSM provides a unified mathematical framework for all systems whose:

* states evolve,
* structures constrain evolution,
* rules remain fixed,
* stability determines long‑term behavior,
* inputs act as rule‑guided transformations,
* feedback modifies structure within fixed rule classes.

Traditionally, system science and control theory are fragmented into:

* linear systems
* nonlinear systems
* adaptive control
* robust control
* optimal control
* networked systems
* distributed systems
* biological control systems

SSCT‑DMSM removes this fragmentation by expressing *all* systems as trajectories in a DMMT space.

# **1. Dynamic Mathematics Embedding**

Under DMMT, a system is represented as:

```
U_sys = (X, Σ, R, T, S)
```

Where:

* **X** = state space of the system
* **Σ** = structural constraints (equations, matrices, networks, architectures)
* **R** = rule set including dynamics + control inputs
* **T** = admissible transitions generated by R
* **S** = stability geometry (Lyapunov-like, basin-based)

System evolution is:

```
τ : (x, σ) → (x', σ')  subject to R
```

This unified form replicates (and generalizes) all classical system equations.

---

# **2. SSCT Core Axioms**

These axioms specialize DMMT for system science and control.

## **Axiom 1 — Fixed Dynamics with Input**

The system evolves according to:

```
x(t+1) = f(x(t), u(t), σ)
```

Inputs **u(t)** are part of the rule layer R.

## **Axiom 2 — Structural Constraint (Σ)**

System structure defines admissible dynamics:

```
f ∈ Σ   ⇔   evolution respects constraints
```

Examples:

* linear structure (A,B matrices)
* nonlinear structure (vector fields)
* networked structure (graph Laplacians)

## **Axiom 3 — Stability Geometry (S)**

Stability S assigns:

* basin identity
* basin depth (robustness)
* attractor class

Equivalent to Lyapunov theory but fully generalized.

## **Axiom 4 — Feedback as Structural Transformation**

Feedback changes structural state:

```
σ → σ' = Feedback(σ, x)
```

But structure class (Σ) is preserved.

## **Axiom 5 — Projection Invariance (Control Equivalence)**

If projection π preserves basin identity:

```
π(x,σ) and (x,σ) are control-equivalent.
```

This generalizes controllability/observability.

# **3. System Representation under SSCT‑DMSM**

## **3.1 Linear Systems**

```
x' = Ax + Bu
```

Map to:

* X = ℝⁿ
* Σ = {A, B}
* R = input rules u(t)
* T induced by linear update
* S from quadratic or basin geometry

## **3.2 Nonlinear Systems**

```
x' = f(x, u)
```

Same structure, richer Σ.

## **3.3 Networked Systems**

```
x' = W x + u
```

Where W is graph-linked structure.

## **3.4 Distributed Systems**

Σ contains multiple interacting subsystems.

All fall under one DMMT form.

---

# **4. Stability in SSCT‑DMSM**

Stability = geometric property of trajectory convergence:

```
stable ⇔ trajectory remains in a single basin B
```

### Advantages:

* removes need for ad‑hoc Lyapunov construction
* stability is intrinsic to system geometry
* applies equally to linear, nonlinear, hybrid, and unknown systems

---

# **5. Control in SSCT‑DMSM**

## **5.1 Control Input = Rule-Guided Transition Modifier**

```
u ∈ R  modifies  T(x,σ)
```

Control is not an external force but part of rule structure.

## **5.2 Optimal Control = Minimal Geometric Complexity Path**

```
min IC_geom(τ)
```

Where:

```
IC_geom(τ) = path_length + Σ barrier_heights
```

Unifies:

* LQR
* MPC
* H∞
* Pontryagin principle

## **5.3 Robust Control = Basin-Depth Preservation**

Robustness measure:

```
R = basin_depth(x,σ)
```

If perturbations do not cross basin boundaries, control is robust.

---

# **6. Controllability & Observability in SSCT**

Both concepts generalize to basin geometry.

## **6.1 Controllability**

A system is controllable iff:

```
∀ basin Bᵢ, ∃ control trajectory τ sending state into Bᵢ.
```

## **6.2 Observability**

Observable iff projection π retains basin identity:

```
π(x) and x lie in same basin.
```

This unifies linear and nonlinear observability.

---

# **7. Feedback Systems in SSCT**

Feedback is a structural transformation inside Σ:

```
σ' = g(σ, x)
```

Examples:

* PID
* state feedback
* adaptive feedback
* network rewiring

All become instances of the same transformation.

---

# **8. System Classification under SSCT‑DMSM**

Every system belongs to one of these classes:

1. **Open-loop systems** (R fixed, u=0)
2. **Closed-loop systems** (feedback structure)
3. **Networked systems** (Σ is graph-like)
4. **Hybrid systems** (Σ contains discrete + continuous)
5. **Distributed systems** (Σ has subsystem decomposition)
6. **Stochastic systems** (R contains probability kernels)

All are mathematically the same under DMMT.

---

# **9. Relation to EMMT (Adaptive & Evolving Systems)**

When Σ or R **change form**:

* adaptive control
* reinforcement learning
* biological control systems
* evolving networks
* neural systems with plasticity

Then the system becomes an **EMMT (M₂) object** rather than M₁.

---

# **10. Summary**

SSCT‑DMSM:

* unifies all system science and control theory under Dynamic Math
* eliminates fragmentation of classical control disciplines
* generalizes stability via basin geometry
* expresses control input as rule-level modification
* expresses optimal control as geometric complexity minimization
* generalizes controllability/observability via projection invariance
* connects seamlessly to adaptive/evolving systems through EMMT

This places system science and control theory as a fully mathematical, fully unified subdiscipline within the Dynamic Mathematics layer.
