# **SIT Compliance Standard — Structural Information Theory (SIT) v1.0**

### *Certification Requirements for Structural Signals, Dynamic Channels, Semantic Basins & Information Geometry*

---

# **0. Purpose**

This document defines the **official compliance and certification requirements** for SIT (Structural Information Theory) v1.0.
It establishes how to verify whether:

* a communication system,
* a signal representation,
* a dynamic channel model,
* an information-processing algorithm,
* a semantic model,
* a learning system,
* or an analysis tool

**is SIT-compliant**.

SIT compliance ensures that systems follow the Dynamic Math standard for information:
**information = structural distinguishability preserved by stability geometry across dynamic channels.**

---

# **1. Compliance Components**

A system must satisfy **five major areas** to be SIT-compliant:

1. **Structural Signal Validity** — rule-based distinguishability
2. **Dynamic Channel Validity** — admissible structural evolution
3. **Information Flow Correctness** — valid trajectories through (x,σ)
4. **Stability & Basin Correctness** — proper semantic geometry
5. **Entropy & Capacity Validity** — correct interpretation of SIT metrics

To receive SIT certification, all five must pass.

---

# **2. Structural Signal Compliance**

A signal representation is SIT-compliant if:

## **2.1 Rule-Generated Structure**

Signals must be generated by valid rule constructors (grammars, structural generators):

```
s = generate(R)
```

## **2.2 Distinguishability Correctness**

Distinguishability must reflect actual structural differences:

```
s1 ≠_structure s2  ⇒  distinguishable
```

## **2.3 Minimal Checklist**

```
[ ] Signal constructed from rule-layer generators.
[ ] Structural distinguishability implemented.
[ ] Noise modeled as geometric perturbation.
```

---

# **3. Dynamic Channel Compliance (σ)**

Channels must be modeled as **evolving structures**, not static transformations.

## **3.1 Admissible Channel Evolution**

```
(x,σ) → (x',σ')  must satisfy SIT transformation rules.
```

## **3.2 Noise Consistency**

Noise = perturbation in channel geometry:

```
σ → σ + δη
```

## **3.3 Channel Checklist**

```
[ ] Channel is dynamic (not fixed).
[ ] Evolution rules documented and reproducible.
[ ] Noise follows geometric perturbation model.
```

---

# **4. Information Flow Compliance**

A system must correctly simulate or implement information flow trajectories.

## **4.1 Valid Trajectories**

```
τ: (x,σ) → (x',σ') must be rule-admissible.
```

## **4.2 Co-evolution Requirement**

Signals and channels must evolve jointly.

## **4.3 Traceability Requirement**

A compliant system must produce a **complete trace** of τ.

## **4.4 Flow Checklist**

```
[ ] Flow computes (x,σ) → (x',σ').
[ ] Transitions follow SIT rules.
[ ] Full trajectory is recorded.
[ ] Deterministic or nondeterministic flow is labeled.
```

---

# **5. Stability & Semantic Basin Compliance**

This is the **core of SIT compliance**.

A system must:

## **5.1 Compute Stability Function**

```
S: I → ℝ
```

## **5.2 Identify Basins**

Basins must be extractable through:

* clustering
* gradient flow
* DGSM geometry
* CNSM attractor analysis

## **5.3 Semantic Preservation**

Meaning is preserved iff basins remain the same:

```
meaning(x,σ) = meaning(x',σ') ⇔ same_basin
```

## **5.4 Semantic Collapse Detection**

Basin merging = loss of meaning.

## **5.5 Basin Checklist**

```
[ ] Basin detection implemented.
[ ] Stability computed for trajectories.
[ ] Basin boundaries identifiable.
[ ] Semantic equivalence = basin equivalence.
[ ] Basin depth = robustness metric.
```

---

# **6. Entropy & Capacity Compliance**

A system must correctly compute SIT’s structural and dynamic information metrics.

## **6.1 Structural Entropy**

```
H_s = log |reachable_structures|
```

## **6.2 Dynamic Capacity**

```
C_dyn = number_of_distinguishable_basins / unit_time
```

## **6.3 Information Complexity**

```
IC_geom = trajectory_length + Σ barrier_heights
```

## **6.4 Entropy/Capacity Checklist**

```
[ ] H_s computed from rule expansion or sampling.
[ ] C_dyn computed via basin distinguishability.
[ ] IC_geom computed using stability geometry.
```

# **7. SIT Certification Levels**

SIT uses three certification levels:

## **Level 1 — Structural Compliance**

Requirements:

* rule-generated signals
* distinguishability computation

Used for:

* parsers
* feature extractors
* static analysis tools

---

## **Level 2 — Dynamic Compliance**

Includes Level 1 +

* dynamic channels
* information flow trajectories

Used for:

* simulators
* adaptive channel models
* communication systems

---

## **Level 3 — Geometric Compliance (Full SIT Certification)**

Includes Level 2 +

* semantic basin extraction
* stability geometry computation
* robustness estimation
* capacity calculation

This is the highest level of SIT certification.

---

# **8. SIT Test Suite**

SIT-compliant systems must pass standardized tests:

### **8.1 Structural Tests**

* distinguishability matrix tests
* rule expansion correctness

### **8.2 Dynamic Tests**

* valid transitions
* co-evolution tests

### **8.3 Geometry Tests**

* basin detection
* semantic boundary detection
* robustness under perturbation

---

# **9. Required Documentation for Certified Systems**

A fully certified system MUST provide:

### **9.1 Mandatory Documentation**

* rule-layer specification
* channel evolution model
* flow transition semantics
* geometric analysis methods
* entropy/capacity computation details

### **9.2 Optional Documentation**

* visualization tools
* optimization strategies
* integration notes for DGSM/CNSM/CTS

---

# **10. Summary**

This compliance standard makes SIT:

* verifiable,
* reproducible,
* interoperable,
* industry-ready,
* research-credible.

With SIT_Standard, SIT_FormalAxioms, SIT_ImplementationGuide, and SIT_Compliance,
**SIT is now a fully completed scientific discipline within Dynamic Math**, reaching the same maturity level as DGSM, CNSM, and CTS.
