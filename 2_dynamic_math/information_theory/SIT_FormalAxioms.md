# **SIT Formal Axioms — Structural Information Theory (SIT) v1.0**

### *A Formal Axiomatization of Information as Structure, Dynamics, and Stability Geometry*

---

# **0. Purpose**

This document establishes the **formal mathematical axioms** of Structural Information Theory (SIT).
It elevates SIT to the same theoretical rigor as:

* DGSM (Dynamic Geometry Standard Model)
* CNSM (Complex Network Science Model)
* CTS (Computation Theory Standard)
* DEST (Dynamic Evolution & Stability Theory)

SIT defines information as **distinguishability generated by rules, propagated through dynamic channels, and preserved by stability geometry**.

These axioms provide the foundation for:

* semantic information flow
* adaptive channels
* structural signal analysis
* robustness & meaning geometry
* dynamic information capacity

---

# **1. Core Mathematical Sets**

We define the objects of SIT.

* **R** — Set of rule constructors (symbol grammars, structural generators)
* **Σ** — Set of channel structures
* **X** — Set of signal states
* **Π** — Set of admissible channel projections
* **T** — Set of admissible transformations
* **B** — Set of stability basins
* **D** — Set of distinguishability relations

The information space is:

```
I = X × Σ
```

Each element is a signal embedded in a channel.

---

# **2. Axiom 1 — Structural Distinguishability**

Two signals carry distinguishable information iff their rule-generated structures differ.

Formally:

```
I(a,b) > 0  ⇔  structure(a) ≠ structure(b).
```

Or equivalently:

```
(a,σ) D (b,σ)  ⇔  R-structure(a) ≠ R-structure(b)
```

D is the primitive information relation.

This axiom replaces probabilistic uncertainty with **rule-based distinguishability**.

---

# **3. Axiom 2 — Dynamic Information Flow**

Information flow is a **trajectory** in the dynamic channel geometry:

```
τ: (x,σ) → (x',σ')
```

subject to:

* rule admissibility
* channel consistency
* structural transformation rules

Formally:

```
((x,σ),(x',σ')) ∈ T  ⇔  allowed by R.
```

This embeds communication into dynamic systems.

---

# **4. Axiom 3 — Stability Geometry Preservation**

Information is preserved if trajectories remain in the same **stability basin**.

Define a stability function:

```
S: I → ℝ.
```

Then preservation holds iff:

```
(x,σ) ~_info (x',σ')  ⇔  they are in same basin B_k.
```

Meaning:

* errors that do **not** cross basin boundaries are non-destructive
* errors that cross boundaries change meaning

This is the geometric foundation of semantic robustness.

---

# **5. Axiom 4 — Noise as Geometric Perturbation**

Noise is modeled as geometric displacement:

```
noise: (x,σ) → (x+ϵ, σ+δη)
```

The system is robust iff such perturbations do not cross basin boundaries.

Formally:

```
noise preserves information  ⇔  S(x+ϵ, σ+δη) ≥ threshold basin depth.
```

This fully replaces classical additive/multiplicative noise models.

---

# **6. Axiom 5 — Meaning as Basin-Level Convergence**

Semantic meaning is defined by the basin reached by information flow.

Formally:

```
meaning(x,σ) = basin_of( limit(τ(x,σ)) ).
```

Thus semantics is a **geometric fixed point** under dynamic evolution.

This unifies:

* classical semantics
* probabilistic meaning
* neural semantic attractors
* biological signaling meaning

---

# **7. Axiom 6 — Structural Entropy**

Structural entropy is defined as the log-size of rule-generated possibilities:

```
H_s = log | reachable_structures |
```

This generalizes Shannon entropy to dynamic and structural systems.

---

# **8. Axiom 7 — Dynamic Channel Capacity**

Channel capacity becomes a function of distinguishable basins:

```
C_dyn = max number_of_distinguishable_basins / unit_time.
```

If basins merge → channel capacity decreases.
If basins separate → channel capacity increases.

This explains why adaptive systems can learn to create *new* information capacity.

---

# **9. Axiom 8 — Information Complexity (IC_geom)**

The cost of transmitting a message is:

```
IC_geom = length(τ) + Σ barrier_heights(τ)
```

parallel to CTS complexity.

This integrates information theory with dynamic systems.

---

# **10. Axiom 9 — Robustness as Basin Depth**

Robustness of information is defined by:

```
R = min_{(x,σ) ∈ basin} S(x,σ).
```

Deep basins = high robustness.

This replaces error probability with geometric stability.

---

# **11. Derived Theorems (Informal)**

### **Theorem 1 — Projection Invariance of Information**

If projections preserve distinguishability, meaning does not change.

### **Theorem 2 — Semantic Collapse as Basin Merging**

Two meanings become indistinguishable iff their basins merge under perturbation.

### **Theorem 3 — Universal Channel Limit**

No system can transmit more meanings per unit time than the number of separable basins.

### **Theorem 4 — Information Formation via Rule Expansion**

New meanings emerge when rule-layer expansion creates new basins.

---

# **12. Summary**

These axioms elevate SIT into a formal, mathematically rigorous information theory.
They position SIT alongside DGSM, CNSM, and CTS as a foundational science based on dynamic structure and stability geometry.

SIT is now ready for:

* formal proofs (Lean)
* implementations (mathOS)
* engineering applications
* scientific publication
