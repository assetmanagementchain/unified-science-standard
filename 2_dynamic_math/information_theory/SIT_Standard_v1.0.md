# **Structural Information Theory (SIT) — Standard Model v1.0**

### *A Unified Dynamic-Math Framework for Information, Signals, Channels, and Stability Geometry*

---

# **0. Overview**

**Structural Information Theory (SIT)** provides a unified mathematical foundation for information as a **dynamic, geometric, and rule-generated phenomenon**.
Unlike classical information theory—which relies on probability, entropy counts, and fixed channels—SIT treats information as:

* a **structural difference** in a generative rule space,
* propagated along **evolving channels**, and
* shaped by **stability geometry** in dynamic systems.

SIT is the information-theoretic pillar of Dynamic Math, fully compatible with:

* DGSM（Dynamic Geometry Standard Model）
* CNSM（Complex Network Science Model）
* CTS（Computation Theory Standard）
* DEST（Dynamic Evolution & Stability Theory）

SIT reframes information from *static uncertainty* → *dynamic geometry of distinguishability*.

---

# **1. Motivation**

Classical information theory assumes:

* fixed channels
* fixed alphabets
* memoryless transformations
* probabilistic uncertainty as the sole source of information

But real-world information systems are:

* adaptive
* structural
* multi-layered
* state-dependent
* dynamically evolving

Thus classical information theory cannot express:

* dynamic channels
* structural signals (graphs, trees, programs)
* evolving communication systems
* semantic transformations
* energy-information coupling

SIT resolves these limitations by placing **structure and dynamics** at the core.

---

# **2. Three-Layer SIT Framework**

SIT inherits the Dynamic Math architecture:

## **2.1 Rule Layer — Generative Information Structure**

Defines:

* symbol generation rules
* structural grammars
* allowable transformations
* distinguishability constraints

Information is **created** at this layer.

---

## **2.2 Dynamic Layer — Information Flow & Channel Evolution**

Traditional channels become dynamic systems:

```
(x, σ) → (x', σ')
```

where:

* **x** = signal state
* **σ** = channel structure

Channels are not fixed—they evolve with:

* noise
* context
* feedback
* external interaction

---

## **2.3 Geometry Layer — Stability, Distinguishability & Basin Structure**

Information becomes a **geometric object**:

* distinguishability = geometric separation
* stability = resistance to distortion
* noise = geometric perturbation
* semantic basin = convergent meaning

Information is preserved when trajectories remain in the same basin.

---

# **3. SIT Axioms**

### **Axiom 1 — Structural Distinguishability**

Information exists iff two signals map to different rule-generated structures.

```
I(a,b) > 0 ⇔ structure(a) ≠ structure(b)
```

---

### **Axiom 2 — Dynamic Information Flow**

Information transmission is a trajectory in dynamic channel geometry.

```
τ: (x,σ) → (x',σ')
```

---

### **Axiom 3 — Stability Preservation**

Information is preserved under transformations that do not cross basin boundaries.

```
(x,σ) ~_info (x',σ')  ⇔  same_stability_basin
```

---

### **Axiom 4 — Noise as Geometric Perturbation**

Noise is a displacement in geometry:

```
noise: (x,σ) → (x+ϵ, σ+δη)
```

with stability depth measuring robustness.

---

### **Axiom 5 — Meaning as Basin Convergence**

Semantic meaning = attractor basin reached by information trajectories.

---

# **4. SIT Core Quantities**

SIT redefines classical information quantities structurally.

## **4.1 Structural Entropy (H_s)**

Not probability-based. Defined as:

```
H_s = log | reachable_structures |
```

Higher structural variety → higher information capacity.

---

## **4.2 Dynamic Channel Capacity (C_dyn)**

Depends on channel geometry & stability:

```
C_dyn = max distinguishable_basins / sec
```

---

## **4.3 Robustness (R)**

Defined as basin depth:

```
R = min S(x,σ) over basin
```

---

## **4.4 Information Complexity (IC_geom)**

```
IC_geom = length(trajectory) + Σ barrier_heights
```

Parallel to CTS.

---

# **5. SIT Integration with DGSM, CNSM, CTS**

### **DGSM**

Information = dynamic geometry of distinguishability.

### **CNSM**

Networks become information channels; message flow = geometry traversal.

### **CTS**

Programs manipulate basins; correctness = basin preservation.

SIT becomes the glue between computation, networks, and dynamics.

---

# **6. SIT System Classification**

### **Class I — Static Information Systems**

* fixed channels
* classical coding theory

### **Class II — Dynamic Information Systems**

* evolving channels
* adaptive noise models

### **Class III — Structural Information Systems**

* graph signals
* program signals
* semantic communication

SIT fully models all three.

---

# **7. SIT Definitions**

* **Signal**: rule-generated structure
* **Information**: structural distinguishability
* **Channel**: dynamic transformation operator
* **Noise**: geometric perturbation
* **Meaning**: basin-level convergence

---

# **8. SIT Compliance Requirements**

A system is SIT-compliant if:

1. It defines rule-layer signal generation.
2. It models dynamic channel evolution.
3. It identifies stability geometry.
4. It computes robustness & distinguishability.
5. It preserves geometric invariants.

---

# **9. Applications**

* robust communication in adaptive networks
* semantic information systems
* biological signaling pathways
* multi-agent systems
* machine learning feature geometry
* error correction via basin stabilization

---

# **10. Summary**

SIT provides the **first unified dynamic-math information theory**, closing the gap between:

* classical entropy models
* dynamic systems
* network communication
* computational processes

SIT elevates information theory to the same structural & geometric rigor as DGSM, CNSM, and CTS.
